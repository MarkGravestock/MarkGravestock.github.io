SBF- Valuation method - chance of making $20 billion on an idea 1% chance of it happening - upside $200m, so this upside
needs to be greater then your costs, e.g.

p(success) * amount(success) > stake?

The issue is the calculation of the probability of success (and also the prediction of the amount you'll make if successful)
but maybe the key issue, assuming opportunity cost or similar is not a concern is the the probability of it happening.

Even if you are a feted genius, then getting the probability right (is it something you know about, or a new area?) is maybe
a tall order, and then even if it right, then it occurring is a another issue entirely.

The same valuation method can be used in situations where the known information is better, for example, if we look at the
UK lottery. The chance of winning is 1 in 45 million, a stake is £1 to buy a ticket, therefore any prize over £45m make it
a ration bet. Assuming you don't share the prize!

45,000,001 * 1/45,000,000 > 1 - rational bet

The valuation logic is based on a similar premise, but in that case both the odd of success and also the amount that could
be made are unknown.

Another topic mention was that of party funding and the idea

information theory, no point in doing things with a high chance of success or failure, there is little information

What are the factors that contribute to individuals success:

- Luck - someone out of the 8 billion people on the planet should strike lucky
- Privilege - their privileged situation (or not)
- Talent/Merit -
- Hard work -

When evaluating successful individuals and when they evaluate themselves
