## About this site

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and relies on the integration it provides with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) in order to generate the static site you are reading from the original source in my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MarkGravestock/MarkGravestock.github.io).

The theme I'm using is called [texture](https://github.com/thelehhman/texture), chapeau to the people who created it!

One sweet feature that I'm using is [remote_theme](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-remote-theme) which is a plug-in that applies a theme store in another GitHub repo to your site, without having to fork the theme into your own repo. Then all you need to store in your own repo is your specific overrides to the theme.
